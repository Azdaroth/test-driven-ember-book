# Closing Thoughts

And that would be it! I hope you enjoyed reading the book and learned some new concepts along the way. The example app was not that complex, yet it should be good enough to illustrate how to apply **TDD** rules when adding new features in any of the Ember apps and how to handle some use cases that are unique for **Ember** or **JavaScript apps** in general. Obviously there are more things that could be mentioned; however, my intention wasn't to cover every possible testing scenario, but to do something much better - to explain testing in such a way that even if you encounter something that looks unfamiliar, you will still be able to isolate the problem and deal with it without much hassle.

If there is still something that is not entirely clear or you disagree with some parts, or maybe you just want to share positive feedback, feel free to reach me at **karol.galanciak@gmail.com**.
